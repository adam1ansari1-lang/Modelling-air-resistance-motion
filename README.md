This problem models a long-distance jump using coupled second-order differential equations that include gravity and air resistance (drag). The drag force acts opposite to motion and depends on position through coordinate-dependent drag coefficients in the horizontal (x) and vertical (z) directions, each defined by a logistic function with adjustable parameters. The task is to numerically solve these ODEs, stopping the simulation when the jumper lands (z = 0), and determine the minimum initial horizontal speed needed to travel more than 8 meters. You must implement the logistic drag function, use event detection in the ODE solver to detect landing, search over parameter combinations to find the smallest qualifying speed (to 0.1 m/s precision), and plot both the drag functions and the resulting trajectory.
